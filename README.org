* Usage

Requires the configuration =api= with the key =urls {array}= and
optionally the key =amountFirstURLsToShuffle {int}= that influences
how many URLs will be shuffled from the =urls= array. Only the first n
URLs will be shuffled so that the locally closest can be put in the
list first and shuffled, but other backup URLs still be used further
behind in the array.
